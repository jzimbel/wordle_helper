# Wordle Helper
A command-line script that finds valid Wordle words given your guesses so far.

The script can help with [English Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Spanish Wordle](https://wordle.danielfrg.com/).

Requires Elixir 1.12 or later. Also make sure the dictionary files are in the same directory as the script.

Run it with:
```sh
$ elixir wordle_helper.exs
```

Enter the command `h` (or `help`) to see a list of available commands.

Enter `q` to exit.
